This is the repo for the mobile app. Repo for server can be found at https://github.com/khoa3101/backend

Our app allows people to report incidents in the city by simply uploading an image. Types of detectable incidents include fallen trees, fire, flooding, poor road conditions, traffic jams, trash, and traffic accidents. 

If the uploaded image depicts any of the above incidents, it will be represented with the corresponding icon at the upload location in the map.
